Here are the general steps to run the VST plugin from the GitHub repository you mentioned:

**Firstly Run this command in the project termial**: **"pip freeze > requirements.txt"**

**Download and install a suitable development environment**: The VST plugin is written in C++, so you will 
need a C++ development environment to build it. You can use a variety of development environments, including 
Visual Studio, Xcode, or Code::Blocks. Choose an environment that you are comfortable with and install it on your computer.

**Download the VST SDK**: The VST plugin uses the VST SDK from Steinberg. You will need to download and install the
SDK before you can build the plugin. You can download the SDK from the Steinberg website at https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html.

**Clone the repository**: Clone the repository from GitHub onto your local machine using the Git command line tool or
a Git desktop client. You can use the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:
**"git clone https://github.com/paladin-pro/VST-plugin.git"**

**Open the project file**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the project file in your chosen development environment.
The project file will be located in the root directory of the repository.

**Configure the project**: Configure the project to use the VST SDK. You will need to set the path to the VST SDK in the project
settings or build configuration.

**Build the project**: Build the VST plugin using the build command in your development environment. 
The build process will compile the C++ code and create a binary file that can be used as a VST plugin.

**Run the plugin**: Load the plugin in a suitable VST host application, such as Ableton Live or FL Studio, and test it to ensure it is working correctly.
